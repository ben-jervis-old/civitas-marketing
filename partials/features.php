				<h4>Member Database</h4>
				<p>
					The member database contains the details of all members of the congregation. This includes details entered by the admin such as name, address and date of birth, as well as generated statistics like attendance and roster roles. It's never been easier to keep track of who's who.

				<h4>Attendance</h4>
				<p>
					<?php inline_brand(); ?> allows users to efficiently and quickly mark the attendance of all people present at any event or service. The list can be filtered by groups, families, or by a good old fashioned search bar, so you never lose track of who turned up. Thanks for coming.

				<h4>Rostering</h4>
				<p>
					The administrators of the system will be able to create rosters for members of the congregtion. Once created they can assign members to tasks within the roster, and the members will be notified and can choose to accept. Many hands make light work, and we've kept the work out of your hands.

				<h4>Contact</h4>
				<p>
					The contact system allows administrators to contact all members in the congregation individually, or by groups. This allows targeted messages to a select group of members, targeting those to whom the message is relevant, while still supporting organisation-wide contact. Less accidental spam for users, less work for you.

				<h4>Notifications</h4>
				<p>
					The alerts and notification system allows administrators to quickly and easily see what tasks in the system require attention. Notifications can be marked as finalised, or left for later resolution. Administrators also have access to notifications assigned to other admins, so that work doesn't stop when someone takes a holiday.

				<h4>Groups</h4>
				<p>
					Small organisations are filled with smaller subgroups, of all different sizes and purposes. Groups in <?php inline_brand(); ?> allow administrators to combine users however they need to. From families to committees to mailing lists, Groups have got it covered.
